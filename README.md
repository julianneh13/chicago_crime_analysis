# Chicago Crime Analysis

Introduction
---------------
This is an analysis of crime trends in the city of Chicago from 2001 - December 14, 2021. I began this project because I have lived in Chicago going on 9 years. Over the past couple years, I have noticed a shift in the amount of crime. I wasn't sure if this was because I was naive and unaware of the levels of crime around me when I first moved here at 18, or the crime rates truly have changed in the time I have lived here. I wanted to back my assumptions with data and learn more about what is happening in my city.

Project Overview

**Project Purpose:** Provide exploratory data analysis on the levels of crime recorded in Chicago, IL.
**Research Questions:**
