# chicago_crime_analysis

This is an analysis of crime trends in the city of Chicago from 2001 - December 14, 2021. I began this project because I have lived in Chicago going on 9 years. Over the past couple years, I have noticed a shift in the amount of crime. I wasn't sure if this was because when I moved to Chicago at 18, I was naive and unaware of the levels of crime around me, or that the crime rates truly have changed in the time I have lived here. 

The dataset has been downloaded from the city of Chicago's government website, https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2.
